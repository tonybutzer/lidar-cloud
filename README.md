Hi Tony

Jason, Josh Mann and I are trying to get a project started on AWS to showcase using its infrastructure on lidar projects. We would like to get something started using BOTO3 etc. to process lidar data. Would you be able to give us an introduction on how we can get started? Really appreciate your help.


Thanks
